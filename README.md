# Digital-Forensics-Image-Analysis-using-Autopsy
Digital forensics is a specific discipline in cybersecurity, where the main objective of learning is to uncover and analyze digital evidence in a legally valid manner. In this tutorial, researchers will gain experience conducting practical digital evidence analysis using Autopsy

**Starting the Autopsy Application**

To begin, open your terminal in Kali Linux and launch the Autopsy application by entering:

If successful, Autopsy will activate port 9999 on the localhost, making it accessible through a web browser.

**Creating a New Case in Autopsy**

Open a browser and navigate to the following URL to access the Autopsy Forensic Browser:

- Click "New Case" to create a new digital forensics case.
- Fill in the required case details:
- After this step, Autopsy will create a directory for the case:

**Create image first**

will use gumager for creating the image of the disk kali linux.
firt make sure have esclated privilege for this

Then we make the image using guymager.

select the simulated attached USB drive and then right click it to acquire an image
